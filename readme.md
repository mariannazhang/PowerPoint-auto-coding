# About this code
This code is for researchers running children in a live supervised setting using PowerPoint stimuli to an Excel datasheet (in long format, rather than tidy format). This code was developed in December 2020 in Visual Basic ("VBA") on Microsoft PowerPoint on Windows and, as of September 2021, also works for Microsoft PowerPoint 2016 for Mac. I'm not sure if there's anything like this for Keynote.

The template slides (`stimuli.pptm`) are adapted from the [online testing slides from Stanford's Social Learning Lab](http://github.com/sociallearninglab/online_testing_materials), and are designed for use by researchers who run live testing sessions by sharing a PowerPoint slideshow on Zoom. The [dictionary custom class](https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-Dictionary) was created by Tim Hall.

There is [an hour long basic video demo of this code](https://stanford.zoom.us/rec/share/vdNnPylMm5UP4nQPozZBKW5riLCHA2-70kaw1uvOUkWbNCb6pE-Ob86nrFj5__lm.3sALdzZfGmAkHRZ4?startTime=1610750420000) (recorded January 15, 2021) available, although there are some screen share difficulties in that video demo, and this readme is more up-to-date than the video demo.

## Why run children live using PowerPoint
Microsoft PowerPoint allows researchers to easily present their studies in a rich and engaging format. PowerPoint supports simple animations and sounds that make the experience much more dynamic and engaging, as opposed to filling out a static [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/) survey together. **Increased engagement can not only benefit data quality for that study, but also creates a more positive and fun experience that incentivizes parents/guardians and children to return for future studies.**

PowerPoint is **simple and easy for researchers to use**, and many researchers have experience using PowerPoint already, as opposed to specialized animation software like Blender. Simple but engaging animations can be created using the ["Morph" transition between slides](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-the-morph-transition-in-powerpoint-8dd1c7b2-b935-44f5-a74c-741d8d9244ea) (equivalent to Keynote "Magic Move"), or slide animations such as pulse and motion path animations.

A major drawback of using PowerPoint has been that participant responses are not automatically coded during the session (as they are when using a Qualtrics survey), so session must be recorded and a researcher must watch the recording after the fact to code participant responses. This code addresses that drawback by automatically coding responses during the session, which **saves researcher time and increases coding reliability**.

## How this code works
This code works by creating a [**dictionary**](https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-Dictionary) called **`data`**, which contains *pairs* of keys and items:
1. **`keys`**: equivalent to column names in the datasheet (e.g. "condition", "measure1", "measure2")
2. **`items`**: this participant's response for that key (e.g. "structural", "yes", "blue")

These `key`-`item` pairs are generated by a variety of macros. Macros can be activated by linking them to objects in PowerPoint, so a specified macro runs when an object is clicked. Most of the currently available macros take `keys` (column/measure names) from the *slide titles* (as seen in View > Outline View). Here are the currently available macros:
- **`measure_buttonName`**: **the main workhorse**. Takes the name of the button clicked (as seen in Home > Select > Selection Pane) as the response.
- `measure_buttonText`: Takes the text within the button clicked as the response. More limited use cases than measure_buttonName, but works if you're too lazy to rename all your objects and your objects are textboxes containing response text anyway.
- `measure_buttonNameAsKey`: Unlike the other macros, this macro takes the name of the button clicked as the `key`. It records "clicked" as the response. Used in situations where you have a variety of objects on a slide and you want to record which/how many are clicked.
- `measure_textEntry_popOut`: Takes the text provided in a pop-out text entry box as the response. Works for transcribing open-ended responses.
- `measure_allocation`: Calculates the number of target objects (objects with unique names including "target") that are closer to each of 2 anchor objects (objects or groups of objects whose name includes "anchor"). Returns *2* key-item pairs: `key` is cleaned name of anchor objects (removes "anchor" (case-insensitive) and underscores surrounding "anchor"), `item` is number of target objects closer to that anchor vs the other anchor. Designed for generalized resource allocation measures where you exit slideshow, move objects around, and then resume slideshow.
- Feel free to make more macros/subs if you need to collect more kinds of responses!

A summary table of all of the currently available macros to record responses:

| Macro                         | `Key` (column name)        | `Item` (response)   |
| ----------------------------- |----------------------------| --------------------|
| **`measure_buttonName`**      | **slide title**            | **button name**     |
| `measure_buttonText`          | slide title                | button text         |
| `measure_buttonNameAsKey`     | button name                | "clicked"           |
| `measure_textEntry_popOut`    | slide title                | pop-out text entry  |
| `measure_allocation`          | cleaned name of 1st anchor object  | number of targets closer to this anchor than the other anchor |
|       (^continued)            | cleaned name of 2nd anchor object  | number of targets closer to this anchor than the other anchor |

*Slide titles* can be seen/edited in View > Outline View, or by directly editing the title textbox.
*Object/button names* can be edited in Home > Select > Selection Pane.

Most of the above macros have different versions depending on how you want to advance slides:
- No auto-advance: Stay on the slide after the response (e.g., to ask subsequent/follow-up questions). Note that this opens the possibility of multiple macro clicks to the same key, in which case the last click will be kept as the response. If you're not auto-advancing, I highly recommend adding sounds when button is clicked to minimize confusion about whether the button was clicked or not.
- **`_advance1`**: **recommended**. Advances 1 slide when clicked to keep things moving and minimize confusion/the number of actions a typical researcher needs to do.
- `_advance2`: Advances 2 slides. Useful for jumping slides during 2-step contingent measures.

2 important macros everyone will need to use:
- `Setup`: Initializes `data`, collects some setup info via a UserForm, sets "in_progress" as "yes", and writes setup info to Excel by calling `inProgress_SaveToExcel`, so you can setup and quit slideshow if you'd like before your participant arrives.
  - Customize this macro's associated UserForm based on your study specifics and what setup info you want researchers to input.
- `SaveToExcel_end`: Calls the function `SaveToExcel`, which saves the scripting dictionary `data` to the Excel datasheet `data.xlsx` by:
  - Finding the datasheet `data.xlsx`.
  - If header row is empty, assigns the `key`s in the order they were collected.
  - Pick out a target row. Look for a row "in_progress" to continue writing to; otherwise, scan down the first column and pick out the first empty row.
  - Sets participant number based on target row, and calculates the file text.
  - Look for each `key` in the header row. Assign the key's corresponding `item` to the cell in the target row in the same column as the `key`.
  - Sets "in_progress" to "no".

A pair of macros that allow exiting and resuming slideshow during a single participant's session:
- `inProgress_SaveToExcel`: Just like `SaveToExcel_end`, it calls the function `SaveToExcel`, except it sets "in_progress" as "yes", which allows subsequent macros to continue writing on the same row. Can be used multiple times throughout a study at any point, and should definitely be used before exiting an in progress slideshow.
- `inProgress_resume`: Re-initializes the `data` dictionary. Should be used immediately after resuming an in progress slideshow. Can be used multiple times throughout a study.

Helper macros to reset target objects on slides (designed for resource allocation using `measure_allocation`). *Note that which slide should be reset must be manually specified.*
- `reset_horizontallyAtBottom`: Resets target objects (objects with unique names containing `target`) on a *manually specified* slide to be evenly distributed along the bottom of the screen (85% of the way down the screen).
- `reset_horizontallyBtwnAnchors`: Resets target objects (objects with unique names containing `target`) on a *manually specified* slide to be evenly distributed horizontally between anchor objects.
- `reset_verticallyBtwnAnchors`: Resets target objects (objects with unique names containing `target`) on a *manually specified* slide to be evenly distributed vertically (minus some headroom for the researcher's video thumbnail) between anchor objects (objects or groups of objects whose name contains `anchor`)
  - Note: change the midline calculations for these reset if your Zoom video thumbnail will not be top center.



# Getting started: adding autocoding to new or pre-existing stimuli
If you are creating new stimuli, or have pre-existing study materials that you'd like to add autocoding functionality to, follow the below steps.

0. **Clone/fork this repo**, or **download the files** here as a .zip and unzip them.
- You can rename the `materials` folder and `stimuli.pptm` to anything you want.
- You can rename the `data` folder and `data.xlsx` to anything you want, or change the folder structure, but make sure to adjust the filepath accordingly in the `SaveToExcel` function so it can find the datasheet.

1. **Clear and customize the datasheet** `data.xlsx`. Clear all data, and add your desired column names to the header row (row 1) in Excel.
  - Make sure the datasheet is the very first sheet in the workbook (you can have subsequent sheets afterwards if you'd like).
  - Make sure to include the following columns: "in_progress" (to allow pause/restarts), "file", and "test_date" (both needed to automate "file").
  - Use the *exact* same text in your column header as your keys, so `SaveToExcel` can appropriately assign participants' responses. *Important exception*: if you are using `measure_allocation`, remove "anchor" and (if present) any surrounding underscores from the column name, since the `measure_allocation` macro will automatically clean that part of the key (eg "resource_allocation_high_anchor" gets cleaned to "resource_allocation_high").
  - You can add more columns than macros assign in your slides (e.g. "parental_interference", "exp_error", "comments"). Such columns will be left blank (e.g. for manual entry after the session).
  - If you choose not to specify a header row, `SaveToExcel` will automatically fill in a header row using the `keys` *in the order they were collected*.

  ![data.xlsx Excel sheet, showing header row of first sheet filled out in an otherwise empty sheet](/readme_images/Excel_headerRow.png)

  _Setting up the datasheet's header row._ Note that the datasheet is the first sheet of the workbook, column names are specified in the first row, and there are columns called "in_progress", as well as columns called "file" and "test_date". The columns in red will not be written to from PowerPoint, and will be left blank for manual entry.


2. **In PowerPoint, make sure macros are enabled.** Macros are usually disabled by default for security reasons.

On PowerPoint for Windows, you'll need [add the Developer menu to your PowerPoint ribbon](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/show-the-developer-tab-e1192344-5e56-4d45-931b-e5fd9bea2d45), by going to File > Options > Customize Ribbon > scroll down the right-hand column and check "Developer". Go to the new Developer menu > click "Macro Security" > "Enable all macros (not recommended; potentially dangerous code can run)"

![Customize Ribbon menu. On the right-hand column, Developer is checked.](/readme_images/enableDeveloper.png)
_Enabling the Developer menu on Windows._ Check "Developer" on the right-hand column.

On PowerPoint 2016 for Mac, go to: PowerPoint > Preferences > Security & Privacy > Macro Security > "Enable all macros (not recommended; potentially dangerous code can run)"

3. **Adapt the template slides** `stimuli.pptm` (`.pptm` means it's macro-enabled) to your stimuli in PowerPoint.
  - If you already have your stimuli slides ready, and you just want to import the autocoding code from `stimuli.pptm`: Open `stimuli.pptm` > go to Developer > Visual Basic > right-click "Module1", "UserForm", "Dictionary" in the left-side project panel under `stimuli.pptm` > Export to somewhere. Then, open your stimuli slides, navigate to the project panel, right-click your stimuli filename > Import the files you just exported. "Module1", "UserForm", "Dictionary" should now show up in the project window.

4. **Add *titles* to slides where macros collect slide titles**. View > Outline View to check the titles of all your slides. If your slide lacks a title, and a macro will be collecting the slide title, double-click the slide in Outline View to add a title. You can drag the Title textbox off-screen, but a Title *must* be present in Outline View.
  - If you have a pre-existing header row in `data.xlsx`, be sure that your slide titles match the *exact* text in the header row, so `SaveToExcel` can appropriately assign participants' responses.
  - Note: two slides can have the same title, but note that if macros on each slide collect the slide title as a `key`, you may overwrite responses to the same `key` (this may not be a problem if participants will only responding on one of the slides, e.g. the 2nd step of a 2 step measure).

5. **Add *object names* to slides where macros collect object names**. Home > Editing > Select > Selection Pane. Double click an object in the Selection Pane to edit its name. If you are counterbalancing the names of objects, remember to change these object names across different counterbalancing slidedecks.

![PowerPoint slide with pictures of blue berries and pink berries, and textbox reading "measure3" just off screen. Outline view is open on the left, showing slide titled measure 2. Selection pane is open on the right, showing objects named blueberries, pinkberries, Title 3, and Title 3.](/readme_images/slide.png)
_A typical slide._ The slide has a Title, here just off-screen (`measure2`), that gives the slide its title in Outline View. Each response button (here, two pictures) is named in Selection Pane (here, as "blueberries", "pinkberries").

  - If you are using `measure_allocation` and its `reset` helper functions, objects that will be moved/counted should have *unique* names containing "target" (e.g. "target1", "target2"). The 2 objects (or groups of objects) that will be reference points for grouping should have names containing "anchor" (e.g. "measure9_lowPerf_anchor"). Note that if you name a group "target" or "anchor", do not also name each sub-object "target" or "anchor".

  ![PowerPoint slide with pictures of two schools, one on the left and the other on right side of the screen, and 6 books arranged vertically between them. Outline view is open on the left, showing slide titled measure10. Selection pane is open on the right, showing objects named blueberries, pinkberries, Title 3, and Title 3.](/readme_images/resourceAllocation.png)
  _A resource allocation slide._ The slide has a Title, here just off-screen (`measure10`), that gives the slide its title in Outline View. In Selection Pane, each target object (here, 6 books) has a *unique* name containing "target", and each anchor object (here, the 2 schools) has a name containing "anchor". Note the three buttons for saving, resuming, and counting the allocation positioned under where the researcher's video thumbnail would go (in this case, top middle).

6. **Link objects to whatever macros you want to run when the object is clicked.** Select an object > Insert > Action > Mouse click > Run macro > select your macro (e.g. `measure_buttonName_advance1`). Particularly if you are not auto-advancing slides, I recommend you check "Play sound" as well, so the button makes a sound when clicked (to minimize confusion about whether it was clicked already or not).
  - Unfortunately, only single objects can be linked to macros. Groups of objects cannot activate macros. You can link a single object in the group, draw an object on top of all of them, or use an image editor to replace them all with a single image.
  - There's no easy to way to see at a glance if an object is linked to a macro, besides trying to reinsert the macro link, so make sure everything that you want linked is linked!
  - If you have a resource allocation slide, the slide should contain objects/buttons linked to each of 3 macros: `inProgress_SaveToExcel` (save before exiting slideshow), `inProgress_resume` (resume after restarting slideshow), and `measure_allocation` (count the allocation). You should also include the corresponding `reset` at the end of your slideshow so you can reset the target objects for the next participant, and can also include `reset` on the allocation slide itself in case participant wants to re-do the allocation. I recommend hiding all these buttons under wherever your video thumbnail will be, to reduce visual clutter for the participant.

![PowerPoint menu showing options for action button, including Run macro and Play sound](/readme_images/linkToMacro.png)

_Linking an object to a macro._ Here the selected object is linked to the `measure_buttonName_advance1` macro. Note the "Play sound" option if you'd like to play a sound, in addition to running the macro, when the object is clicked.

7. **Open VBA.** On PowerPoint for Windows, open VBA by going to Developer menu > Visual Basic. On PowerPoint for Mac, go to Tools > Macros > Visual Basic Editor.

8. **Customize the main code**. Go over to the left-hand Project Explorer sidebar. (If you don't see it, Ctrl + R, or View > Project Explorer). Click `Module1` to bring up the main code. Ctrl+F through the code for "TODO" for places you should double-check and customize, e.g. the filepath to the datasheet, the slides to reset for resource allocation if relevant.

![View in VBA looking at Module 1, with SaveToExcel macro selected](/readme_images/VBA.png)
_A typical view in VBA._ Here we are in the code for `Module1`, specifically the `SaveToExcel` function. Note that the Project Manager sidebar is at the top left.

9. **Customize the setup userform**. Go to the left-hand Project Manager sidebar, and right-click `UserForm`.

- Right-click `UserForm` > View Object to [edit the fields and aesthetics of the form](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/powerpoint/how-to/create-custom-dialog-boxes). View > Toolbox to insert new fields: `TextBox` accepts any value, `ListBox` requires selecting from pre-specified values, `ComboBox` suggests pre-specified values but accepts other values too. Click on a field to see/edit its name on the sidebar; you will need to know its name to reference its value in the form code.

![View in VBA looking at the UserForm object](/readme_images/VBA_UserForm_object.png)
_Viewing the UserForm object._ Here we are looking at the `UserForm` object, and can move around the fields, change how the fields look, and change how the form generally looks. At bottom we have the Toolbox, with which we can add new textboxes or fields (View > Toolbox if you can't see the Toolbox menu). At bottom left is the Properties menu, where we can see that the selected field is a `ListBox` object (`ListBox` only accepts specified values) named `condition`.

- Right-click `UserForm` > View Code to edit the code behind the form, including how the values from each form field are saved to the `data` dictionary.

![View in VBA looking at the UserForm code](/readme_images/VBA_UserForm_code.png)
_Viewing the UserForm code._ Here we are looking at the `UserForm` code, specifically how the UserForm is initialized. Note that the form field `condition` is initialized with specified values for `condition` ("condition1", "condition2", and "condition3") that users can choose from.



# Getting started: setting up your computer to run pre-existing autocoding stimuli
If you have received pre-existing autocoding-enabled stimuli from someone, and would like to get it ready to run on a new computer, follow the below steps.

1. **Check that your folder structure and filenames match what is expected.** Talk to the person who created the stimuli to find out how you should set up your folder structure. By default, `stimuli.pptm` will search up one level, and in a folder called "data" to find a datasheet called `data.xlsx`.

2. **In PowerPoint, make sure macros are enabled.** Macros are usually disabled by default for security reasons.

On PowerPoint for Windows, you'll need [add the Developer menu to your PowerPoint ribbon](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/show-the-developer-tab-e1192344-5e56-4d45-931b-e5fd9bea2d45), by going to File > Options > Customize Ribbon > scroll down the right-hand column and check "Developer". Go to the new Developer menu > click "Macro Security" > "Enable all macros (not recommended; potentially dangerous code can run)"

![Customize Ribbon menu. On the right-hand column, Developer is checked.](/readme_images/enableDeveloper.png)
_Enabling the Developer menu on Windows._ Check "Developer" on the right-hand column.

On PowerPoint 2016 for Mac, go to: PowerPoint > Preferences > Security & Privacy > Macro Security > "Enable all macros (not recommended; potentially dangerous code can run)"

3. Test run the stimuli in slideshow to make sure all expected functionality is present.



# Running participants live
- **Make sure `data.xlsx`, the Excel data sheet, is closed** so PowerPoint can edit it.
- **Click "Setup" to fill out the setup form before the participant arrives**.
  - It's recommended to fill out the setup form before the participant arrives, so the participant/guardian are blind to condition. You may exit slideshow after completing the setup form, because `Setup` will save everything to Excel (using `inProgress_SaveToExcel`). When the participant arrives and you restart the slideshow, be sure to click "resume" (`inProgress_resume`) to pick up from where you left off.
  - Alternatively, you can fill out the form with the participant present, but be aware that the participant/guardian may not be blind to condition if they see you filling out the form. Click "pause share" in Zoom to freeze the screen share, click "Setup" to fill out the form, and then click "resume share" in Zoom once you're done with the form. The participant will see a frozen screen while you're filling it out.
- If you use 2 monitors and see your slideshow on both (e.g. sharing slides, not sharing presenter view), pop-ups will appear on whichever window you click the button. So if you click pop-up buttons like "Setup" on the non-shared screen, pop-up will appear on non-shared screen.
- You can run your slides and click macros in any order or number of times. Note that if you try to write to the same `key` multiple times, the *last* written response will be the final response.
- **`data` will be lost if you exit slideshow before running a `SaveToExcel` macro**.
  - To jump between *slides* without exiting slideshow, right-click anywhere on the slide in slideshow > See all slides > select a slide.
  - To switch between *windows* without exiting slideshow, tab out of slideshow using `Alt + Tab` on Windows or `Cmd + Tab` on Mac, or try swiping left or right on your mousepad with 3 fingers.
  - If the session is ended early, and won't be picked up, jump to the last slide and run `SaveToExcel_end`, or manually set "in_progress" on the datasheet to "no".
  - **Record your sessions!** This code does not replace a recording of your sessions. Be prepared to reference your recording as a backup in case of data loss/premature exit.
- You may run multiple participants in the same PowerPoint session, since the code will autoreset the `data` dictionary during initial setup, and `data` is also cleared when you exit slideshow.



# Customizing the VBA code even further if you'd like
Open VBA in PowerPoint: Developer > Visual Basic.

Useful functions for dealing with the `data` dictionary:
- `data(key) = item` stores the item under "key". If the key already exists, the previous item is overwritten. If the key did not exist, it will create a new pair.
- `data(key)` calls the item stored under the key.
- `data.Keys` calls all the keys, and `data.Items` calls all the items. Note: these functions return arrays, which are 0-indexed in VBA, so `data.Items(0)` calls the 1st item, `data.Items(1)` the 2nd, and so forth.

Tips for editing in VBA:
- Always declare your variables (using e.g. `Dim`, `Public`, or `Private`) before you initialize them. `Public` is useful if you want to be able to reference the variable/function outside of its block.
- Check your types. `Variant` can helpfully take on a variety of types, including an error (which can be checked using `IsError()`). Other types will generally crash if you feed them an error. `CStr()` coerces non-`String` types into a `String`, and [here are some other coersion functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/concepts/getting-started/type-conversion-functions).
- Be aware that objects (annoyingly) vary in whether they are 0-indexed (1st item is in position 0) or 1-indexed (1st item is in position 1). Arrays are by default 0-indexed, although you can set the starting index to be something else. Strings and collections are 1-indexed.
- Remember to end your loops with the corresponding `End` (e.g. an `If` requires an `End If`).

- VBA does not automatically wrap your code. Add ` _ ` (space _ space) at the end of a line to continue code on the next line. Or write your code in a code editor like [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Atom: File > Settings > Packages > install `language-vba` for VBA syntax highlighting).
- Comment your code! `'` begins a comment.

- Test run test run test run. Build and test new code in small steps so you can more easily isolate problems when your code breaks.

Tips for PowerPoint when editing in VBA:
- In PowerPoint, you can find/edit names of objects in Home > Select > Selection Pane, and titles of slides in View > Outline View. Note that slide titles (indicated by title text and in Outline View) are apparently different from slide names (an internal name indicated when you open a slide in VBA, somewhat difficult to change).
- If you rename a macro, you'll need to relink the buttons that used to reference that macro to that macro. There is no easy way to tell at a glance if a button is linked to a macro or not, so be careful, double-check your links by trying to reinsert a link, and always test run.

Debugging VBA:
- Debug > Compile VBAProject is your friend. When you make changes, run this and make sure it doesn't freak as first pass for errors.
- Watch > Add Watch to keep an eye on select variables while you're running code blocks, like the R environment.
- If you're running into some bug, try printing a key variable with `print` (print to the "Immediate" window at the bottom of your VBA screen), or have it pop out in a `MsgBox` at a key point in your code to see what's wrong.
- If the Excel file is locked for editing when you open it, force quit Excel from Task Manager and check your code for errors.
- If the Excel file did not update, or if a button that should have done something didn't do something, check your code for errors.

# Collaborating and sharing your files
Some users may find that if you upload the .pptm file to Google Drive (either manually drop into Google Drive on browser, or using Google Drive for Desktop), Google Drive automatically converts it to a .pptx file and removes the macros. You can make sure this auto-conversion is disabled by [going to Google Drive in your web browser](https://drive.google.com/) > click Gear icon at top-right > Settings > make sure "Convert uploaded files to google docs editor format" is NOT checked, [as per this StackExchange post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62759230/is-my-vba-code-lost-when-saving-to-google-drive).



# Future improvements
Here are some improvements I'm thinking to do. Definitely feel free to put in a feature request for me, or make edits and improvements to the code yourself too!
- Automatically detect which slides are resource allocation slides in `reset_allocation`.
- If user specifies header row but forgets to add "in_progress" column, automatically add an "in_progress" column during `SaveToExcel`.
